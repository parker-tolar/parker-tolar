# Hi, I'm Parker 👋
**Applied AI Product Builder of
Narrative learning systems** 

blending psychology + code. 100% Upwork success.  

## What I Build

- **Roblox Systems**
  Persistent player data (equipment, relics), tweened UI, 3D viewport effects, and battle simulation logic.

- **Therapy Psycho-education & SEL Apps** (React / Next.js / Tailwind / Firebase)
  Gamified screeners with currency rewards, narrative driven SEL curricula, micro-courses ,and card-based mechanics with flip animations.

- **Authoring & Utility Tools**
  Drag-and-drop canvas editors and PDF parsing / summarization tools for rapid content generation.

- **TCG / TTRPG Hybrid Systems**
  Cooperative, raid-style gameplay where group-therapy concepts are embedded directly into mechanics, cards, and progression loops.
